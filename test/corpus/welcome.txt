Welcome to our project!

This is a simple text file that we can use to test the new plain text editor functionality. It has multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines and demonstrates how the tree-sitter plain parser works with unstructured text.

Here's another paragraph with some information about the project. This paragraph is longer and contains more detailed information about what we're trying to accomplish.

Some key features:
- Easy to use semantic editing
- Support for multiple file formats
- Tree-sitter based parsing
- Node-level operations
Perfect! The plain text editor is working great.

Let's see how the editor handles this content!
